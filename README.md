# Mini-Golf-New
The final project for BCS427 (the Unity course) was to make a game.  As a bonus it could be in VR.  I helped develop this VR mini-golf game as part of what ended up being a group project after COVID hit and the school moved to remote learning in I think April.

Also it's "new" because there was some confusion when including it into the group project.  I ended up just making a new repo as a back up (this), pushing my work to the new group Git, and working there.  The link to the final project is here -- https://github.com/Kingal1337/VR-Mini-Games
